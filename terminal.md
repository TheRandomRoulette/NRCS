# Terminal Tips

## Tab Completion
Any time you hit the tab button while typing in terminal, the system will try and auto-complete what you are typing. For example, let's say you create a folder called "myprojectwithareallylongname". Try it now:
1.  type `cd ~` to go to your home directory
2.  type `mkdir myprojectwithareallylongname`, which creates a folder called myprojectwithareallylongname
3.  type `cd  mypro`, then hit tab, and you'll see tab completion at work

## Usefull Commands
- `ls` gives you a list of all the folders and files in the current directory
- `ls -a` gives you a list of all the folders and files in the current directory, including the hidden files and folders
- `cd` allows you to change the directory and move around the file system
- `mkdir [foldername]` creates a folder in the current directory with the folder name you specify
- `touch [filename.txt]` creates a file with the name and extension you specify
